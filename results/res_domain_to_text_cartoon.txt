/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:481: UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 4 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 2, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
